 * thread and communicates through a MediaTrackTranscoderCallback instance. Transcoded samples are
 * enqueued on the MediaTrackTranscoder's output queue. Samples need to be dequeued from the output
 * queue or the transcoder will run out of buffers and stall. Once the consumer is done with a
 * transcoded sample it is the consumer's responsibility to as soon as possible release all
 * references to that sample in order to return the buffer to the transcoder. MediaTrackTranscoder
 * is an abstract class and instances are created through one of the concrete subclasses.
 *
 * The base class MediaTrackTranscoder is responsible for thread and state management and guarantees
 * that operations {configure, start, stop} are sent to the derived class in correct order.
 * MediaTrackTranscoder is also responsible for delivering callback notifications once the
 * transcoder has been successfully started.
